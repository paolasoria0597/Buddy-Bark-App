# Buddy Bark

## Description

**Buddy Bark** is a web application designed to help dog shelter administrators manage their shelters and available dogs for adoption. With Buddy Bark, users can create and manage shelter information, add, edit, and delete dog profiles, and interact with other shelter admins by viewing and exchanging ideas about their available dogs. The app provides a simple and user-friendly interface to streamline the adoption process for shelters and helps users organize and keep track of their available dogs.

### Why I built this app

I built Buddy Bark to provide dog shelters with a platform where they can easily manage their facilities and pets. As a dog lover and owner of a rescued dog, I wanted to create a solution that could help shelters, like the one where I adopted my dog, organize their information efficiently. This makes it easier for potential adopters to find their perfect dog while helping shelters promote their animals through a centralized system."

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The core language used to build the back-end logic and front-end interactivity.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used to run the server-side of the app.
- **Express.js**: Framework used to create the RESTful routes and handle HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB**: Database used to store data such as users, shelters, and dogs.
- **Mongoose**: ODM library used to model and interact with MongoDB.
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)**: Templating engine used to render dynamic views.
- **CSS**: For styling the user interface.
- **Session-based Authentication**: Used to securely authenticate and authorize users.

## Next Steps

Here are some features and enhancements I plan to implement:

1. **User notifications**: Add a feature that allows shelter admins to be notified when someone shows interest in adopting a dog.
2. **Dog adoption status**: Enable tracking of a dog's adoption status, so users can mark dogs as "Adopted" and keep records.
3. **Photo gallery**: Expand the current dog image feature into a gallery where users can upload multiple photos of each dog.
4. **Search filters**: Add search filters to help potential adopters filter dogs based on criteria such as age, breed, and adoption status.
5. **Mobile optimization**: Further enhance the app for mobile responsiveness
